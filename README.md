This is a Tic Tac Toe app for The Odin Project curriculum

First I made it work in conosle, then converted it to using the dom

It is a small project, but I feel I learned some good lessons.
  -Git is your friend when you mess up haha.
  -You can always refactor your code to be better/more efficient
  -Where there is a will there is a way
    -Just because a problem is frustrating doesn't mean you can't solve it. Take a break and come back later
  -Code reviews are your friend
  -My first instinct is to make things way more complicated than they have to be.  
    -This is something that I will continue to work on. I believe as I get more experience I will get better with this.

All in all, I had fun with this and can't wait for my next project. I feel more confident and capable in my programming skills.
